AI Based Vulnerability Detection System

A simple artificial intelligence system, 
changing the file code from the user, 
controls the code for numbers, 
and then uses a machine learning model to decide:
Is the code weak (has a vulnerability) or secure (safe), and displays the result on a website built with Flask and Bootstrap.
Flask : The Python backend framework bottle builds the server logic and APIs
Bootstrap: front-end library works on designing interfaces (CSS/JS) quickly and ready-made.
